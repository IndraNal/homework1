                    I did my bachelors in India as a Electronics and communication Engineer. I completed my masters in MIS from University of Houston. I love to play table tennis. 
                    I am sociable, friendly, self-controlled and like to challenge myself to improve my skill. I am a jolly-natured person, who believes in team work. Some of my friend's call me as "life saver" because I am very helpful to them. I believe in “SMART” work rather than “HARD” work.  I love the opportunity to learn new things that are challenging. My Favorite Quote is "A journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step". My favorite books are "Ponniyin Selvan" and "Five Point Someone". My most annoying habit  is sleeping too much. I love to eat Indian foods. My Favorite Vacation Spot is Glacier National Park. I would like to spend my weekend with family. My personal hero is my dad. Person I would like to meet most is my mom. The deceased person I would most like to meet is Mahatma Gandhi - Father of our Nation. I don’t like to give advice. 
                    The best advice I have received is "Don’t look at the past failures, keep moving forward".

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)

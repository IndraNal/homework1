                    I did my bachelors in India as a Electronics and communication Engineer. I completed my masters in MIS from University of Houston. I love to play table tennis. 
                    I am sociable, friendly, self-controlled and like to challenge myself to improve my skill. I am a jolly-natured person, who believes in team work. Some of my friend's call me as "life saver" because I am very helpful to them. I believe in “SMART” work rather than “HARD” work.  I love the opportunity to learn new things that are challenging. My Favorite Quote is "A journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step". My favorite books are "Ponniyin Selvan" and "Five Point Someone". My most annoying habit  is sleeping too much. I love to eat Indian foods. My Favorite Vacation Spot is Glacier National Park. I would like to spend my weekend with family. My personal hero is my dad. Person I would like to meet most is my mom. The deceased person I would most like to meet is Mahatma Gandhi - Father of our Nation. I don’t like to give advice. 
                    The best advice I have received is "Don’t look at the past failures, keep moving forward".
